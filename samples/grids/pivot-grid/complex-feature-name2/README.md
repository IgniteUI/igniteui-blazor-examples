 Most gird samples should be create as xplatform samples using `IG Editor` app and saved in [igniteui-xplat-examples](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-xplat-examples/tree/master) repository. Only complex samples (with a lot of code-behind) should be added to the [igniteui-blazor-examples](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-blazor-examples/tree/vnext/samples/grids) repository.

 NOTE: Do not change this readme file because it is auto-generated by gulp script.

 NOTE: You will need to complete all TODO comments to render PivotGrid component.
